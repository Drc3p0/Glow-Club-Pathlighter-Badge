<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This PCB was created as a workshop aid to teach people about LEDs and soldering, and as a way to demistify the process of importing custom art layers into Kicad.  The PCB is intended to be worn on a lanyard, as a way to keep us all glowing safely at night. It was debuted at SOAK '22 for the There U Glow electronics education camp, and provided as a soldering workshop for ToorCamp '22 participants.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Welcome

This PCB was created to teach people how to solder, and to be passed out to the honorary new members of the glow club @ SOAK 2022.  
The designs are free to be modified however you'd like.  

### Build it! 

Components are easy to source and assemble.
Uses a [generic AAA single battery holder x2](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/12BH412-GR), your favorite 5mm LED!  (we like these [colorchanging ones](https://www.amazon.com/Multicolor-Flashing-Changing-Electronics-Components/dp/B01C19END2/ref=sr_1_13?crid=3ENC4HC6ILEX9&keywords=slow+flash+led+5mm&qid=1654971525&sprefix=slow+flash+led+5mm%2Caps%2C144&sr=8-13)), and this
